# esp8266-arm-swd
Proof-of-concept ESP8266 web server and ARM Serial Wire Debug client!

This directory is an Arduino sketch.

The Serial Wire Debug client here is a slightly adapted version of the one I originally wrote for Fadecandy's factory test infrastructure. It has optional extensions for the Freescale Kinetis microcontrollers, but the lower-level SWD interface should be compatible with any ARM microcontroller.
